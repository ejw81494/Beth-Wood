		<h3> How My Thanksgiving Break Has Been </h3>
		<p> <i> I work as a Patient Care Assistant for individuals with Dementia. This is a job that I really value but let me tell you, it is hard work. I worked on Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and two twelve hour shifts the following two days. Combined with the fact that it is the end of the school semester, I feel horribly exhausted. If something happens to me, know that I had a heart attack from the stress. My family, who lives in Forsyth County, got together a day early to celebrate Thanksgiving so that I could be there. I was very glad to see everyone. I made the "dressing", which I have never done and actually isn't a dish that I typically like, but it was very good and my little sister's boyfriend said it was actually the best he had ever had. </i> </p>

		<h3> "Frustration" </h3>
		<p> <i> I wish I didn't have to write out three paragraphs for this project. I am just now finding this out and it is 11:37 pm on November the 26th. I also just found out that I need to submit an extra document explaining my webpage. <strike> We will see if I make it in time.</strike> It's now 10:00 PM on November 27th, and I still haven't turned this in.  I am so horribly indecisive in everthing that I do, perhaps I will have an easy semester this spring. I just want to do something easy, I cannot handle it all. I'll also tell you, I've spent the past two hours trying to embed audio into the background of this webpage. I haven't figured it out. I may or may not continue trying after I have submitted this. </i> </p>

		<h3> My College History </h3>
		<p> <i> I started college at GCSU in Milledgeville, studying Environmental Science. I got into UGA despite the fact that I was a pretty crappy high school student. Believe it or not, I actually was offered a little scholarship money as well. I don't remember that because I was adamant about not attending UGA regardless of acceptance, because I thought a small town would be so cute. I was wrong, it was lonely, and now I am here without the scholarship money. Go figure. I briefly entertained a degree in Geology, a subject I love, and then went crazy and had a hardship withdrawal. I think I did this several times, because I also tried to pursue Biology, which was horrible. I have learned that even if things are going horribly, just finish it out, even in flames. I am majoring now in Anthropology, which is what I enjoy most and what is easy, but I am also majoring in Ag Econ, which is interesting but frankly I don't know if it is the right direction for me, my dad just pushes me in a "practical" direction. I may end up wanting to simply major in Anthropology and become a nurse. I am good at caring for others. </i> </p>
